1
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,680
''Among the rugged peaks
that frown down upon the Borgo Pass

2
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,000
are found crumbling castles
of a bygone age.''

3
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,960
I say, driver, a bit slower.

4
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,680
Oh, no! We must reach
the inn before sundown.

5
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,440
And why, pray?

6
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,800
It is Walpurgis Night.
The Night of Evil! Nosferatu!

7
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,200
On this night, madam,
the doors, they are barred,

8
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,240
and to the Virgin we pray.

9
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,640
(incantation in Hungarian)

10
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,080
(woman speaks Hungarian)

11
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,280
(excited shout in Hungarian)

12
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,480
I say, porter, don't take my luggage down.
I'm going on to Borgo Pass tonight.

13
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,000
(speaks Hungarian)

14
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,800
No, no, please. Put that back up there.

15
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,680
The driver, he is afraid - Walpurgis Night.

16
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,160
Good fellow, he is.

17
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,640
He wants me to ask if you can wait
and go on after sunrise.

18
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,800
Well, I'm sorry, but there's a carriage
meeting me at Borgo Pass at midnight.

19
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,840
- Borgo Pass?
- Yes.

20
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,720
- Whose carriage?
- Count Dracula's.

21
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,320
- Count Dracula's?
- Yes.

22
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Castle Dracula?

23
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,840
Yes. That's where I'm going.

24
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,080
- To the castle?
- Yes.

25
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,680
No. You mustn't go there.

26
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,400
We people of the mountains believe...
at the castle there are vampires.

27
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:42,360
Dracula and his wives,
they take the form of wolves and bats.

28
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:49,800
They leave their coffins at night
and they feed on the blood of the living.

29
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,640
Oh, but that's all superstition.
Why, I can't understand why...

30
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,320
(speaks Hungarian)

31
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,480
Look. The sun.

32
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,480
When it is gone, they leave their coffins.

33
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,760
Come. We must go indoors.

34
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
But wait...

35
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,880
I mean, just a minute.

36
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,720
What I'm trying to say
is that I'm not afraid.

37
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,320
I've explained to the driver
that it's a matter of business with me.

38
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,480
I've got to go. Really.

39
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Well, good night.

40
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
Wait. Please.

41
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,320
If you must go, wear this.

42
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,480
For your mother's sake. It will protect you.

43
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,680
(cries of consternation)

44
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,640
(rats squeak and scurry)

45
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,520
(wolf howls)

46
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,360
(driver) Borgo. Borgo.

47
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,120
Hyah!

48
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,600
The coach from Count Dracula?

49
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
Hey, driver!

50
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,400
I say, driver, what do you mean
by going at this...

51
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,600
(clanking... door creaks open)

52
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
(squeaking)

53
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,960
I am... Dracula.

54
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, it's...

55
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,400
It's really good to see you.

56
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,480
I don't know what happened
to the driver and my luggage and...

57
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,160
Well, and with all this,
I thought I was in the wrong place.

58
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
I bid you welcome.

59
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,800
(wolf howls)

60
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Listen to them.

61
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,640
Children of the night.

62
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,120
What music they make!

63
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,360
The spider spinning his web
for the unwary fly.

64
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,840
The blood is the life, Mr Renfield.

65
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,520
Why, er...

66
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,040
yes.

67
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm sure you will find
this part of my castle more inviting.

68
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,240
Well, rather! It's quite
different from outside.

69
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,840
Oh, and the fire - it's so cheerful.

70
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,760
I didn't know but that
you might be hungry.

71
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,320
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

72
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,280
But I'm a bit worried about my luggage.
You see, all your papers were in...

73
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,920
I took the liberty of having
your luggage brought up.

74
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Allow me.

75
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Oh, yes.

76
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,440
Thanks.

77
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,320
(wolf howls)

78
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,440
I trust you have kept
your coming here a secret.

79
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,560
I've followed your instructions implicitly.

80
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,040
Excellent, Mr Renfield.

81
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Excellent.

82
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,240
And now, if you're not too fatigued,

83
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,960
I would like to discuss
the lease on Carfax Abbey.

84
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,880
Oh, yes. Everything is in order,
awaiting your signature.

85
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,800
Look here. Here's the lease.

86
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,960
Oh, I... I hope I've brought
enough labels for your luggage.

87
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,480
I'm taking with me only three... boxes.

88
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Very well.

89
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,720
I have chartered a ship
to take us to England.

90
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,680
We will be leaving... tomorrow evening.

91
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,480
Everything will be ready.

92
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,720
I hope you will find this comfortable.

93
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,880
Thanks. It looks very inviting.

94
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,560
Ouch!

95
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,160
Oh, it's nothing serious.
Just a small cut from that paperclip.

96
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,600
It's just a scratch.

97
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,360
This... is very old wine.

98
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,800
I hope you will like it.

99
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,920
Aren't you drinking?

100
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,720
I never drink... wine.

101
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,960
Well...

102
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,000
It's delicious.

103
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,800
And now I'll leave you.

104
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Well, good night.

105
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,800
Good night... Mr Renfield.

106
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
(bat squeaks)

107
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,160
Master, the sun is gone.

108
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,040
You will keep your promise when
we get to London, won't you, master?

109
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,680
You will see that I get lives?

110
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,640
Not human lives, but... small ones.
With blood in them!

111
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,040
I'll be loyal to you, master.

112
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,920
I'll be loyal.

113
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,440
(men's voices)

114
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,080
(first man) Must be a Scandinavian ship.

115
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,360
(second man) Here, now.
Here, now. Get back.

116
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,480
Nobody goes aboard this here boat
but the authorities.

117
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,760
(third man) Captain dead,
tied to the wheel.

118
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,080
Horrible tragedy. A horrible tragedy.

119
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,440
Master! We're here!

120
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,080
You can't hear what I'm saying,
but we're here.

121
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
We're safe!

122
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,080
(third man) They must've come
through a terrible storm.

123
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,760
(deranged laughter)

124
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,040
What's that?

125
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
(footsteps)

126
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,600
Why, it's come from that hatchway.

127
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,560
(deranged guttural laughter)

128
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,640
Why, he's mad! Look at his eyes.

129
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,360
Why, the man's gone crazy.

130
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
(klaxon)

131
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
(car horns)

132
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,320
Violets! Violets!
Flower for your buttonhole, sir.

133
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,680
Flower for your buttonhole, sir. Flower
for your buttonhole. Here's a nice one.

134
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,960
(girl screams)

135
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,760
(police whistle)

136
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
(answering whistles)

137
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,280
(orchestra plays Wagner-
''Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg'')

138
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,680
(movement ends)

139
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,600
And after you've delivered the message,
you will remember nothing I now say.

140
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Obey.

141
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,440
- Dr Seward?
- Yes?

142
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,360
You're wanted on the telephone.

143
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,720
Oh, thank you. Well, excuse me, dears...

144
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,680
Oh, Father, if it's from home, will you say
I'm spending the night in town with Lucy?

145
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,040
(chuckles) All right, dear.

146
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,720
- Pardon.
- Yes?

147
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,440
I could not help overhearing your name.

148
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,760
Might I inquire if you are the Dr Seward
whose sanitarium is at Whitby?

149
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,640
Why, yes.

150
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,520
I'm Count Dracula.

151
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,120
I have just leased Carfax Abbey.
I understand it adjoins your grounds.

152
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,000
Why, yes, it does. I'm very happy
to make your acquaintance.

153
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,480
May I present my daughter, Mina...

154
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,000
Count Dracula.

155
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,240
- Miss Weston...
- How do you do?

156
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,040
- And Mr Harker.
- How do you do?

157
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,520
Count Dracula has just
taken Carfax Abbey.

158
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,440
Oh, it'll be a relief to see life
in those dismal old windows.

159
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,480
It will indeed. You'll excuse me -
I'm wanted on the telephone.

160
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,640
The abbey could be very attractive.

161
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,440
But I should imagine it would need
quite extensive repairs.

162
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,440
I shall do very little repairing.

163
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,360
It reminds me of the broken battlements
of my own castle in Transylvania.

164
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,160
The abbey always reminds me
of that old toast:

165
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,520
''Above, lofty timbers,
The walls around are bare,

166
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,080
Echoing to our laughter,
As though the dead were there.''

167
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,560
- Nice little sentiment!
- But there's more, even nicer.

168
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,440
''Quaff a cup to the dead already,
Hurrah for the next to die...''

169
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,720
Oh, never mind the rest, dear!

170
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,880
To die, to be really dead...

171
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,880
that must be glorious.

172
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Why, Count Dracula!

173
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,160
There are far worse things...
awaiting man...

174
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
than death.

175
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,360
(music box chimes)

176
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,360
(Mina, mimicking) It reminds me...
of the broken battlements...

177
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,520
of my own castle in Transylvania.

178
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,120
Oh, Lucy, you're so romantic!

179
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Laugh all you like. I think he's fascinating.

180
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,400
Oh, I suppose he's all right.

181
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,360
But give me someone
a little more normal.

182
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,120
Like John?

183
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,440
Yes, dear. Like John.

184
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,240
Castle... Dracula.

185
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Transylvania.

186
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,680
Well, er... Countess,

187
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,640
I'll leave you to your count
and his ruined abbey.

188
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,280
- Good night, Lucy.
- Good night, dear.

189
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,760
The fog seems to be
closing down a bit, sir.

190
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,160
Another death.

191
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Dead?

192
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,880
Dr Seward, when did Miss Weston
have the last transfusion?

193
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,240
About four hours ago.

194
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,960
An unnatural loss of blood,
which we've been powerless to check.

195
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,400
On the throat of each victim
the same two marks.

196
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,920
- (nurse) Keep your hands covered.
- I don't want to keep my hands covered.

197
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,040
- But you said you would.
- I don't want to.

198
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,320
- Now please do as you said you would.
- I don't want to.

199
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,080
(man screams)

200
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,240
(patient) He probably wants
his flies again! (manic laughter)

201
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,960
(man) No, Martin, please!
Please don't, Martin!

202
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,000
No, Martin, please! Please, Martin!

203
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,960
No, Martin! Oh, Martin, please!

204
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,360
- Here, give it to me now, I tell you!
- No, Martin, please!

205
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,240
No, Martin. Martin, don't!
Don't throw my spider away from me!

206
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Oh, Martin... Oh...

207
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,280
Ain't you ashamed now? Ain't you?

208
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Spiders now, is it?
Flies ain't good enough?

209
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Flies? Flies?!

210
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,120
Poor puny things!

211
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,560
Who wants to eat flies?

212
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,480
You do, ya loony!

213
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,400
Not when I can get nice fat spiders!

214
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,360
All right. Have it your own way.

215
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,560
Read, Dummkopf, where I have marked.

216
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:20,000
Deinde cum extractum
vesiculionis sanguine mixtum est,

217
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,600
sanguis puniceo color
amisso lactteus fit.

218
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,600
Gentlemen, we are dealing
with the... undead.

219
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,840
Nosferatu!

220
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,920
Yes, Nosferatu. The undead. The vampire.

221
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,880
The vampire attacks the throat.

222
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,120
It leaves two little wounds,
white with red centres.

223
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,040
Dr Seward, your patient Renfield,
whose blood I have just analysed,

224
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,680
is obsessed with the idea
that he must devour living things

225
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
in order to sustain his own life.

226
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,000
But, Professor Van Helsing,

227
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,920
modern medical science
does not admit of such a creature!

228
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,320
The vampire is a pure myth, superstition.

229
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:22,720
I may be able to bring you proof
that the superstition of yesterday

230
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,240
can become the scientific reality of today.

231
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,080
But, Professor, Renfield's cravings
have always been for small living things.

232
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,480
- Nothing human.
- As far as we know, Doctor.

233
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,800
But you tell me that he escapes
from his room. He's gone for hours.

234
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Where does he go?

235
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,040
(voice approaches)

236
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,960
..so you won't have to eat flies.

237
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,640
Well, Mr Renfield,

238
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,480
you are looking much better than you did
this morning when I arrived.

239
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,840
Thanks. I'm feeling much better.

240
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,640
I am here to help you.

241
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,120
You understand that, do you not?

242
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Why, of course. And I'm very grateful.

243
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,880
- Keep your filthy hands to yourself!
- Now now, Renfield.

244
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,440
Oh, Dr Seward, send me away
from this place! Send me far away!

245
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,760
Why are you so anxious to get away?

246
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,080
My cries at night -
they might disturb Miss Mina.

247
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,760
Yes?

248
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,840
They might give her bad dreams,
Professor Van Helsing.

249
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,520
Bad dreams.

250
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,680
(wolf howls)

251
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
(wolf howls)

252
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,480
(thud)

253
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,680
That sounded like a wolf.

254
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,960
Yes, it did. But I hardly think
there are wolves so near London.

255
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
He thinks they're wolves.

256
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,720
Me, I've heard 'em howl at night before.

257
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,480
He thinks they're talking to him!

258
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,640
He 'owls and 'owls back at 'em.
He's crazy!

259
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,000
I might have known. I might have known.

260
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,840
We know why the wolves talk,
do we not, Mr Renfield?

261
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,440
And we know how
we can make them stop.

262
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,120
Argh!

263
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,360
You know too much to live, Van Helsing!

264
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,320
Now now, Renfield.

265
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,120
We will get no more out of him now
for a while.

266
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,680
Take him away, Martin.

267
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,000
On your way, old fly-eater.

268
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,840
I'm warning you, Dr Seward,
if you don't send me away

269
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,320
you must answer
for what will happen to Miss Mina!

270
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,760
- All right, Martin.
- Come along now. Come along.

271
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,600
What was that herb that excited him so?

272
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,840
Wolfbane. It is a plant
that grows in central Europe.

273
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,240
The natives there use it to protect
themselves against vampires.

274
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,480
Renfield reacted very violently
to its scent.

275
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,120
Seward, I want you to have Renfield
closely watched by day and night.

276
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,480
Especially by night.

277
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
(sobs)

278
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,160
(wolf howls)

279
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Yes, master.

280
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,640
Master, you've come back.

281
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,240
No, master, please...
Please don't ask me to do that.

282
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,400
Don't. Not her.

283
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,040
Please! Please don't, master!

284
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Don't, please!

285
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,440
Please...

286
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,280
Oh, don't...

287
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,800
I laid in bed for quite a while... reading.

288
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,760
And just as I was commencing
to get drowsy, I heard dogs howling.

289
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,640
And when the dream came...

290
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,200
it seemed the whole room
was filled with mist.

291
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,960
It was so thick I could just
see the lamp by the bed,

292
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,200
a tiny spark in the fog.

293
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,520
And then I saw two red eyes
staring at me,

294
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,040
and a white, livid face
came down out of the mist.

295
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,640
It came closer... and closer.

296
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,080
I felt its breath on my face...

297
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,240
and then its lips!

298
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,280
Dear, it was only a dream.

299
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,760
And then in the morning I felt so weak.

300
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,640
It seemed as if all the life
had been drained out of me.

301
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,480
Darling, we're going to forget
all about these dreams

302
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,800
and think about something cheerful,
aren't we?

303
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,520
- Allow me?
- Oh. Certainly, Professor.

304
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Think for a moment.

305
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,520
Is there anything that might
have brought this dream on?

306
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,640
No.

307
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:59,280
Doctor, there's something troubling Mina.
Something she won't tell us.

308
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,200
And the face in the dream - you say
it seemed to come closer and closer?

309
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
The lips touched you?

310
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,120
Where?

311
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,720
Is there anything the matter
with your throat?

312
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,720
- Oh, no. But I...
- Permit me.

313
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,440
- No, please...
- Yes. Yes.

314
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,000
How long have you had
those little marks?

315
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,560
- Marks?
- Please.

316
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,640
- Mina, why didn't you let us know?
- Do not excite her.

317
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
When, Miss Mina?

318
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,920
Since the morning after the dream.

319
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,160
- What could have caused them?
- (maid) Count Dracula.

320
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,320
It's good to see you back again, Doctor.

321
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,200
I heard you have just arrived.

322
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,520
And you, Miss Mina,
you're looking exceptionally...

323
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,120
(Van Helsing) Pardon me, Dr Seward...

324
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,720
but I think Miss Mina
should go to her room at once.

325
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,560
Professor Van Helsing, I don't believe
it's as important as you seem to think.

326
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Excuse me. Count Dracula,
Professor Van Helsing.

327
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,400
Van Helsing.
A most distinguished scientist,

328
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,680
whose name we know...
even in the wilds of Transylvania.

329
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,360
I had a frightful dream a few nights ago.

330
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,600
I don't seem to be able
to get it out of my mind.

331
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,760
I hope you haven't taken
my stories too seriously?

332
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,440
Stories?

333
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,160
Yes.

334
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,360
In my humble effort
to amuse your fiancee, Mr Harker,

335
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,760
I was telling her some rather... grim tales
of my far-off country.

336
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,040
I can imagine.

337
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,000
Why, John!

338
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,880
I can quite understand
Mr Harker's concern.

339
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,160
I'm afraid it's quite serious.

340
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,640
My dear, I'm sure
Count Dracula will excuse you.

341
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,520
You must go to your room,
as Professor Van Helsing suggests.

342
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,720
Oh, but really, Father,
I'm feeling quite well.

343
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,360
You had better do as your father advises.

344
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,560
Very well.

345
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,640
Good night.

346
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,680
John.

347
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,720
Miss Mina, may I call later
and inquire how you are feeling?

348
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,680
Why, yes. Thank you.

349
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,040
I'm sorry, Doctor,
my visit was so ill-timed.

350
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,440
Not at all.

351
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,240
On the contrary, it may prove
to be most enlightening.

352
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,560
In fact, before you go,
you can be of definite service.

353
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,800
Anything I can do, gladly.

354
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,560
A moment ago I stumbled
upon a most amazing phenomenon.

355
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,200
Something so incredible
I mistrust my own judgment.

356
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,080
Look.

357
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,160
Dr Seward, my humble apology.

358
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,640
I dislike mirrors.

359
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,760
Van Helsing will explain.

360
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,160
For one who has not lived
even a single lifetime...

361
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,040
you are a wise man, Van Helsing.

362
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,000
Phew!

363
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,240
What on earth caused that?

364
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,800
Did you see the look on his face?
Like a wild animal!

365
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,200
Wild animal? Like a madman!

366
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,120
What's that, running across the lawn?
Looks like a huge dog!

367
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,640
Or a wolf?

368
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,520
A wolf?

369
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,880
- He was afraid we might follow.
- Follow?

370
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,400
Sometimes they take the form of wolves.
But generally of bats.

371
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,080
What are you talking about?

372
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,360
Dracula.

373
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,400
But what's Dracula got to do
with wolves and bats?

374
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,720
- Dracula is our vampire.
- But surely, Professor...

375
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:26,160
A vampire casts no reflection in the glass.
That is why Dracula smashed the mirror.

376
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,160
I don't mean to be rude,
but that's the sort of thing

377
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,320
I'd expect one
of the patients here to say.

378
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,720
Yes. And that is what your English
doctors would say, your police.

379
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,320
The strength of the vampire
is that people will not believe in him.

380
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,320
But, Professor, vampires
only exist in ghost stories.

381
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,640
A vampire, Mr Harker,
is a being that lives after its death

382
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,200
by drinking the blood of the living.
It must have blood or it dies.

383
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,520
Its power lasts only
from sunset to sunrise.

384
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,760
During the hours of the day it must rest
in the earth in which it was buried.

385
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,240
But then, if Dracula were a vampire, he'd
have to return every night to Transylvania.

386
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,560
And that's impossible!

387
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,360
Then he must have brought
his native soil with him.

388
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,560
Boxes of it. Boxes of earth
large enough for him to rest in.

389
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,360
(manic laughter)

390
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,560
Renfield?!

391
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,120
What are you doing there? Come here.

392
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,640
Did you hear what we were saying?

393
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,280
Yes, I heard something.

394
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,640
Enough.

395
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,160
Be guided by what he says.

396
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,160
It's your only hope.

397
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,880
It's her only hope.

398
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,040
I begged you to send me away,
but you wouldn't.

399
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,760
Now it's too late. It's happened again.

400
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,040
(Harker) What's happened?

401
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,880
Take her away from here.
Take her away before...

402
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,360
(squeaking)

403
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,080
No, no, master!
I wasn't going to say anything!

404
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,400
I told them nothing!
I'm loyal to you, master!

405
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,120
What have you to do with Dracula?

406
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,120
Dracula?

407
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,120
I never even heard the name before.

408
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,960
You will die in torment if you die
with innocent blood on your soul.

409
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,400
Oh, no.

410
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,040
God will not damn a lunatic's soul.

411
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,840
He knows that the powers of evil are
too great for those of us with weak minds.

412
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,640
(woman screams)

413
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,080
Oh, Mr Harker! Mr Harker, it's horrible!

414
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,440
Oh, it's horrible! Dr Seward!
Miss Mina... Out there, dead!

415
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,920
- Out where?
- Out there!

416
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,800
(Renfield laughs)

417
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,800
Thank heaven she's alive.
Thank heaven for that!

418
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,840
Alive, yes. But in greater danger,
for she's already under his influence.

419
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,000
Oh, it's horrible, Van Helsing, horrible!
Incredible!

420
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:15,440
Incredible, perhaps, but we must face it,
we must cope with it.

421
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,720
As these attacks continue, she comes
more and more under his power.

422
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,320
(child cries)

423
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,360
''Further attacks on small children,

424
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:53,160
committed after dark by the mysterious
woman in white, took place last night.''

425
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:01,560
''Narratives of two small girls, each child
describing a 'bootiful lady in white'

426
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,400
who promised her chocolates,
enticed her to a secluded spot,

427
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,360
and there bit her slightly in the throat.''

428
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,640
- Ghosts!
- Vampires.

429
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,920
And then, Miss Mina?

430
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,200
What could she know
about the woman in white?

431
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,640
- It's bad enough for her to read about it...
- Please, please, Mr Harker.

432
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,680
And when was the next time you saw
Miss Lucy after she was buried?

433
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,880
I was downstairs on the terrace.

434
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,120
She came out of the shadows
and stood looking at me.

435
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,320
I started to speak to her.

436
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,040
And then I remembered she was dead.

437
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,760
The most horrible expression
came over her face.

438
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,240
She looked like a hungry animal. A wolf.

439
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,760
And then she turned
and ran back into the dark.

440
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,600
Then you know the woman in white is...

441
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,000
Lucy.

442
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:22,320
Miss Mina, I promise you that
after tonight she will remain at rest,

443
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,160
her soul released from this horror.

444
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:29,720
If you can save Lucy's soul after death,
promise me you'll save mine.

445
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,440
Darling, you're not going to die.
You're going to live.

446
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,560
No, John. You mustn't touch me.

447
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,800
And you mustn't kiss me - ever again.

448
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,480
What are you trying to say?

449
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,800
You tell him.

450
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,680
You make him understand. I can't.

451
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,920
Professor...

452
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,000
It's all over, John.

453
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,400
Our love, our life together.

454
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,640
Oh, no.

455
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,040
No, no, don't look at me like that.

456
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,760
I love you, John. You.

457
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
But this horror... He wills it.

458
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,080
(Van Helsing) Miss Mina,
you must come indoors.

459
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,360
You must.

460
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,800
Do you know what you're doing to her,
Professor? You're driving her crazy!

461
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,640
Mr Harker, that is what
you should be worrying about.

462
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,240
The last rays of the day's sun will soon be
gone and another night will be upon us.

463
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,520
(door opens)

464
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,960
Dr Seward, I'm taking Mina with me
to London tonight, or I'll call in the police.

465
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,160
- But, John...
- Mina, please get your bags packed.

466
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,320
Seward, I must be master here
or I can do nothing.

467
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,800
Quite.

468
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,520
Miss Mina, both this room
and your bedroom

469
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,760
have been prepared with wolfbane.

470
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,200
You will be safe if Dracula returns.

471
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,760
She'll be safe all right,
because she's going with me!

472
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,640
- Mina, I'll be waiting for you in the library.
- Oh, John!

473
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,400
Father, talk to him.
Please don't let him go.

474
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
Oh, Briggs.

475
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,000
Miss Mina is to wear this wreath
of wolfbane when she goes to bed.

476
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,680
Watch her closely and see
that she does not remove it in her sleep.

477
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,640
I understand.

478
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,360
And under no circumstances
must these windows be opened tonight.

479
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,440
Very well, sir.

480
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,280
(wolf howls)

481
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,720
(thud)

482
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,840
You will recollect that Dracula
cast no reflection in the mirror.

483
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,400
Yes.

484
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,680
And that three boxes of earth
were delivered to him at Carfax Abbey.

485
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,320
Quite.

486
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,720
And, knowing that a vampire
must rest by day in his native soil,

487
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,320
I am convinced that
this Dracula is no legend,

488
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,280
but an undead creature whose life
has been unnaturally prolonged.

489
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,920
(Harker) Well, Dr Seward, what about it?
Is Mina going with me or not?

490
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,400
If you take her from under our protection,
you will kill her.

491
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,080
Now, John, please, please, be patient.

492
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,160
Mr Harker, please, come here.

493
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,400
Well?

494
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,880
John, I know you love her.

495
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,440
But don't forget she's my daughter,
and I must do what I think is best.

496
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,920
Mr Harker, I have devoted my lifetime
to the study of many strange things -

497
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,240
little-known facts which the world
is perhaps better off for not knowing.

498
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:17,880
I know. But, Professor, all I want
is to get Mina away from all of this.

499
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,960
That will do no good.

500
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,560
Our only chance of saving Miss Mina's life

501
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,200
is to find the hiding place
of Dracula's living corpse

502
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,640
and to drive a stake through its heart.

503
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:34,480
(Renfield) Isn't this a strange conversation
for men who aren't crazy?

504
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,960
Renfield! You're compelling me
to put you in a straitjacket.

505
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,240
You forget, Doctor,
that madmen have great strength.

506
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,360
Dracula has great strength, eh, Renfield?

507
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,240
Words, words, words!

508
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,880
Oh, Martin. Didn't I warn you
to keep a strict watch?

509
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,440
What?

510
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,400
What, again?!

511
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,480
Yes, sir. At once, sir.

512
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,240
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

513
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,760
Here, the doctor's pet loony
is loose again.

514
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,320
He came and stood below
my window in the moonlight.

515
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,120
And he promised me things.

516
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,840
Not in words, but by doing them.

517
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,280
Doing them?

518
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,080
By making them happen.

519
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:33,360
A red mist spread over the lawn,
coming on like a flame of fire.

520
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,240
And then he parted it.

521
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,720
And I could see that
there were thousands of rats,

522
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,520
with their eyes blazing red -
like his, only smaller.

523
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,640
And then he held up his hand
and they all stopped.

524
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,800
And I thought he seemed to be saying...

525
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,120
''Rats, rats... rats!''

526
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:11,360
''Thousands... millions of them!''

527
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,240
''All red blood!''

528
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,160
''All these will I give you...

529
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,840
if you will obey me.''

530
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,760
What did he want you to do?

531
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,800
That which has already been done.

532
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,920
Strike me down dead, Doctor!
He's got me going!

533
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,800
Now he's twisted and broken
them iron bars as if they was cheese.

534
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,080
- Dracula is in the house!
- In the house?!

535
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,680
Doctor, this time he can do no harm.
We are ready for him.

536
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,800
Martin, come. I'll show you where we can
put Mr Renfield where he won't escape.

537
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,520
Maybe you're right, but I have me doubts.
Come along, old fly-eater.

538
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:59,600
Now you mustn't get out of it this time.
You've got to stay in your room...

539
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,560
Van Helsing!

540
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,080
Now that you have learned
what you have learned,

541
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,640
it would be well for you
to return to your own country.

542
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,720
I prefer to remain, and protect
those whom you would destroy.

543
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,600
You are too late.

544
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,680
My blood now flows through her veins.

545
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,760
She will live through
the centuries to come...

546
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,760
as I have lived.

547
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,840
Should you escape us, Dracula,

548
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,840
we know how to save Miss Mina's soul,
if not her life.

549
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,240
If she dies by day.

550
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,840
But I shall see that she dies by night.

551
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,840
And I will have Carfax Abbey
torn down stone by stone,

552
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,160
excavated a mile around.

553
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,640
I will find your earth box
and drive that stake through your heart.

554
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Come here.

555
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,240
Come...

556
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,960
here.

557
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,240
Your will is strong,

558
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,640
Van Helsing.

559
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,040
More wolfbane?

560
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,000
More effective than wolfbane, Count.

561
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,560
Indeed?

562
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,240
(snarls)

563
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,280
(Mina) Open the windows, Briggs,
let in some air!

564
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:26,840
The odour in the room from that horrible
weed! It's stifling! I can't stand it!

565
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,080
- But the professor gave orders.
- Never mind the professor now.

566
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,080
Now, please, go back to bed at once.
I'm going to call your father.

567
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,720
What is it, Briggs?

568
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,800
I don't know, Mr Harker.

569
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,560
I felt strangely dizzy.

570
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,360
And when it cleared away, Miss Mina was
up and dressed and out on the terrace.

571
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,200
- And I can't get her to go to bed.
- Well, let me see her. Tell her I'm here.

572
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,840
John?

573
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,680
Oh, John, I'm so glad you're here.

574
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,200
What have they been doing to me, dear?

575
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,560
Locking me in my room! Oh, and
the horrible smell of that awful weed.

576
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,800
It's been like a nightmare.

577
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,840
What's been the matter?

578
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

579
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,200
Mina...

580
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,080
You're so... like a changed girl.

581
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,880
Oh, you look wonderful!

582
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,000
I feel wonderful.
I've never felt better in my life.

583
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:27,560
I'm so glad to see you like this.
I've been awfully worried about you.

584
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,240
Mr Harker, you'd better
bring Miss Mina inside.

585
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,000
That's all right, Briggs - now that I'm here.

586
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,320
Run along, Briggs. Don't worry.

587
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,800
John... Look, the fog's lifting.

588
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,800
See how plain you can see the stars.

589
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,880
Yes.

590
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,880
Millions of them.

591
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,480
I've never seen them so close.

592
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,760
Why, it looks as if you could
reach out and touch them.

593
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,480
Would you like me to get you a ha...

594
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,280
Why, what's the matter?

595
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,800
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

596
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,560
Come. Let's sit down.

597
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,520
Van Helsing.

598
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,520
Seward. That which I feared
from the beginning has happened.

599
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,680
What?

600
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,600
Dracula boasts that he has fused
his blood with that of Miss Mina.

601
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,920
In life she will now become
the foul thing of the night that he is.

602
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,880
- But Van Helsing...
- Come, Seward.

603
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,920
There's not a moment to be lost.

604
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,920
Oh, but I love the fog!
I love nights with fog.

605
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,960
Well, only yesterday you said
you were afraid of the night.

606
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,440
But, darling, I could never have said
anything so silly! I couldn't!

607
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:48,840
I love the night.
Why, it's the only time I feel really alive.

608
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,640
- There's that bat again!
- (bat squeaks)

609
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,960
- Yes?
- Shoo!

610
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,240
- Look out. He'll get in your hair.
- (squeaking)

611
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,800
Yes?

612
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,040
- My, that was a big bat.
- (squeaking)

613
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,120
I will.

614
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,480
You will what?

615
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,640
Why, I didn't say anything.

616
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,520
Yes, you did. You said ''I will''.

617
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,400
Oh, no, I didn't.

618
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,080
John... Come, sit down.

619
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,760
There must be some way,
some way to save her.

620
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,440
There is only one...

621
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:30,520
(Mina) John, that funny little old
professor... He has a crucifix.

622
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,560
Now I want you to get it
away from him and hide it.

623
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,960
But why, dear?

624
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,800
Oh, he'll be wanting to protect me again -

625
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,040
from the night, or Count Dracula,
or whatever it is.

626
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,600
Well, I don't know. He may be right, Mina.

627
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,080
Your eyes!

628
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,200
They look at me so strangely.

629
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,240
Mina!

630
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,720
- Mina, you're...
- No, Mina, no!

631
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,680
(Mina screams)

632
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,720
Give me that!
What's the idea? Have you gone crazy?

633
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,160
- Are you trying to frighten her to death?!
- No, I was trying to save her.

634
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,120
Save her? That's a fine way!

635
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,040
It's all right, darling.

636
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:27,200
Oh, John, darling!
You must go away from me!

637
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,680
(wails)

638
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,160
The cross! Put it away!

639
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,320
After what's happened
I can't bear to look at it.

640
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,280
- What's happened?
- I can't tell you. I can't.

641
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,520
But you must. You must tell me.
I have a right to know.

642
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,040
Oh, John...

643
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,760
You can believe everything he says.
It's all the truth.

644
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,160
Dracula, he...

645
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,880
Dracula?!

646
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,840
What's he done to you, dear? Tell me.

647
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,760
He came to me.

648
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,600
He opened a vein in his arm...
and he made me drink.

649
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,680
(gunshot)

650
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,480
What is it? Who is it, Martin?

651
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,280
It's that big grey bat again, sir.

652
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,440
There's no use wasting your bullets,
Martin. They cannot harm that bat.

653
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,880
No, sir.

654
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,040
He's crazy!

655
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,120
They're all crazy.

656
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,920
They're all crazy except you and me.

657
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,800
Sometimes I have me doubts about you.

658
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,800
Yes.

659
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,280
(creaking)

660
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,400
(Harker) That's Renfield!
What's he doing at the abbey?

661
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,920
Come, Mr Harker.

662
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,440
(creaking)

663
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,960
(clanking)

664
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,080
Master! Master, I'm here!

665
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,520
Where else would he be going
but to Dracula?

666
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:27,360
What is it, master?
What do you want me to do?

667
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,560
Look! Here's an opening.

668
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,600
(Harker) Mina!

669
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,080
Mina!

670
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:43,720
I didn't lead them here, master!
I didn't know, I swear!

671
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,280
No! No!

672
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,360
(Dracula) Wait!

673
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,320
I'm loyal to you, master.

674
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,680
I'm your slave. I didn't betray you!

675
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,920
Oh, no, don't! Don't kill me!

676
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,800
Let me live, please!

677
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,640
Punish me, torture me, but let me live!

678
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,680
I can't die with all those lives
on my conscience!

679
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,880
All that blood on my hands!

680
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,440
Argh! Argh!

681
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,440
Mina! Mina!

682
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:55,880
- He'll kill her if we don't get to her!
- (Van Helsing) We must not be too late.

683
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,760
We have him trapped! Day is breaking!
We have him trapped!

684
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:01,760
(woman screams)

685
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,080
He's killing her!
Mina! Mina, where are you?

686
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,960
Mina! Mina!

687
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Mina, where are you?

688
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,320
Mina?

689
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,320
Mina?

690
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,120
Mina! Mina!

691
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,440
Harker! Harker!

692
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,720
- See her?
- Come.

693
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,160
Where? Where are you?

694
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,880
Here. Here, Harker. I have found them.

695
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,040
Get me a piece of stone - anything -

696
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:11,440
to help me drive the stake
through their hearts.

697
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
(banging)

698
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,000
Is she...? How does she...?

699
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
She is not here.

700
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,000
Then... then she may be alive!

701
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,160
Mina! Mina!

702
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,680
Mina!

703
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,400
Mina!

704
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,240
- (hammer blow)
- (groan)

705
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,520
Aarghh...

706
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,040
(groan trails off into silence)

707
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,880
(Mina shrieks)

708
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,920
Mina!

709
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,000
Mina! Mina!

710
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,240
Oh, John! John, darling!

711
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,640
I heard you calling,
but I couldn't say anything.

712
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,600
We thought he'd killed you, dear.

713
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,600
The daylight stopped him.

714
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,920
Oh, if you could have seen
the look on his face!

715
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,920
There's nothing more to fear, Miss Mina.
Dracula is dead for ever.

716
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,760
No, no, no. You must go.

717
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:53,000
- But aren't you coming with us?
- Not yet. Presently. Come, John.

718
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,480
(church bells)
